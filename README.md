# Analyzing-Blinkit-s-Sales-and-Outlet-Trends

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the key factors that influence sales performance at Blinkit. Using a structured retail dataset, we explore how product characteristics (like item type, fat content, visibility, and weight) and outlet attributes (such as size, type, location, and establishment year) impact total sales across different Blinkit stores.

## Tools and Libraries Used
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
* NumPy – numerical operations

## Concepts Used
1 **Data Cleaning** - Standardizing Categorical values, handling missing values (e.g., in Sales and Item Weight), and detecting/removing outliers using IQR methods.
