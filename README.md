# Analyzing-Blinkit-s-Sales-and-Outlet-Trends

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the key factors that influence sales performance at Blinkit. Using a structured retail dataset, we explore how product characteristics (like item type, fat content, visibility, and weight) and outlet attributes (such as size, type, location, and establishment year) impact total sales across different Blinkit stores.

## Tools and Libraries Used
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
* NumPy – numerical operations

## Concepts Used
* **Data Cleaning** - Standardizing Categorical values, handling missing values (e.g., in Sales and Item Weight), and detecting/removing outliers using IQR methods.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** - Comparing sales across different outlet and product attributes using descriptive statistics.
* **Data Aggregation** - Grouping data by variables such as item type and outlet type to compute total sales, average sales.
* **Visualization** - Creating insightful visual representations using bar plots, scatter plots, line charts, and pie charts to communicate trends and anomalies effectively.
* **Statistical Analysis** - Calculating correlations (e.g., between Item Visibility and Sales), and using summary statistics like mean, median, and IQR to support findings and derive meaningful insights.

## Conclusion
* **Item Type** is a major driver of sales, with categories like **Fruits and Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** consistently achieving higher revenue.
* **Outlet Type** and **Size** are strongly linked to performance **larger, supermarket-format** outlets outperform smaller or grocery-type outlets.
* **Outlet Establishment Year** suggests that **older, more established outlets** generally experience higher sales, possibly due to **customer loyalty and operational maturity**.
* The relationship between **Item Visibility and Sales appears weak**, indicating that visibility alone is not a reliable sales driver.
* High sales of **low-fat products** indicate that people are concerned about their health and prefer healthier options.

## Recommendations
* **Optimize Inventory Around High-Performing Item Types**.
* **Prioritize Investment in High-Performing Outlets**.Expand or upgrade larger, well-established outlets, especially Supermarket Type1 formats, to maximize ROI.
* **Reevaluate visibility strategies**, as high visibility alone doesn't guarantee higher sales consider combining it with targeted promotions.
* **Leverage Outlet Age as a Strength**.Use long-established outlets as testbeds for introducing new products or marketing initiatives due to their higher and more stable sales performance.
