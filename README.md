# Analyzing-Blinkit-s-Sales-and-Outlet-Trends

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the key factors that influence sales performance at Blinkit. Using a structured retail dataset, we explore how product characteristics (like item type, fat content, visibility, and weight) and outlet attributes (such as size, type, location, and establishment year) impact total sales across different Blinkit stores.

## Tools and Libraries Used
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
* NumPy – numerical operations

## Concepts Used
* **Data Cleaning** - Standardizing Categorical values, handling missing values (e.g., in Sales and Item Weight), and detecting/removing outliers using IQR methods.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** - Comparing sales across different outlet and product attributes using descriptive statistics.
* **Data Aggregation** - Grouping data by variables such as item type and outlet type to compute total sales, average sales.
* **Visualization** - Creating insightful visual representations using bar plots, scatter plots, line charts, and pie charts to communicate trends and anomalies effectively.
* **Statistical Analysis** - Calculating correlations (e.g., between Item Visibility and Sales), and using summary statistics like mean, median, and IQR to support findings and derive meaningful insights.
